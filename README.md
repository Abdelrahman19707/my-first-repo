## ðŸŽ“ Student Management System  
A console-based academic management tool built with **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
ðŸ”— [View Project](https://github.com/Abdelrahman19707/my-first-repo/tree/main/Student-Management-System)

### My Contributions:
- Designed and implemented core system classes (`Instructor`, `Administrator`, `Student`) using OOP concepts like inheritance and composition.
- Developed role-based access control: instructors could submit grades, admins managed users and courses.
- Built functions for user authentication, grade tracking, and enrollment operations while minimizing code duplication.

## ðŸ§  Scala Chatbot & Quiz Game  
An interactive **Scala-based** chatbot that supports **fun educational quizzes** and **fact-based Q&A** using structured JSON data.  
ðŸ”— [View Project](https://github.com/Abdelrahman19707/my-first-repo/tree/main/scala_project)

### My Contributions:
- Built and integrated the **chatbot interaction function** (`respondto`) for engaging Q&A sessions based on user input.
- Designed and structured the **JSON data model** to support historical, scientific, and geographic facts across multiple subcategories.
- Contributed to utility functions for parsing user input and formatting responses.
